            The journey started when H.E. Nasser Al Neyadi obtained one helicopter and a wind tunnel and began training.
            Then in 2010, with the honorable blessing of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum,
            Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of Dubai Executive Council, Dubai hosted its first international
            parachuting championship at the Palm Dropzone. Soon after the name Skydive Dubai was born, launched by H.E.
            Nasser Al Neyadi.

            Skydive Dubai welcomes skydiving enthusiasts from across the UAE, and scores of tourists whose to-do list
            begins with an adrenaline-fueled tandem skydive. Not to forget the steady stream of licensed skydivers who
            also visit.

            The brand is also known for its constant pursuit of excellence in aerial sports and holds multiple Guinness
            World Records to prove it.

            Skydive Dubai operates out of two locations. The Palm DZ, its premium dropzone is located within the limits
            of the emirate, while the desert DZ is located about 35 km outside the city.

            The main attraction at the Palm DZ is the spectacular view of the iconic Palm Jumeirah island. Customers can
            take in the stunning site as they soar at 13,000 ft with one of our many qualified tandem instructors.

            Experienced skydivers looking for some freefall fun are also welcome and can avail of a full-service rigging
            loft and the gear rental facilities at the Palm DZ.

            Over at the desert DZ, the tandem skydive experience has proved to be just as popular. After all, imagine
            sailing over expansive and mesmerizing sandy dunes at 13,000 ft? It’s quite magnificent. But that’s not all.
            Those interested in learning how to skydive solo can also do so at the dropzone.

            If you’re an experienced skydiver looking to add a new skill to your repertoire, the desert’s flight school
            offers coaching on formation skydiving, freefly, canopy and wingsuit coaching.</p>
